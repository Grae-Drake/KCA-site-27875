      Kitsap Cultural Access is a community initiative to increase access to
      arts, culture, heritage, and science across Kitsap County, particularly
      for  youth.


      Our goals are to:


      *   Support public programs in arts, culture, heritage, and science


      *   Increase access and remove barriers to these programs, particularly
      for youth


      *   Improve livability measures in Kitsap County like...


      *   Improve economy....


      Our first step is to develop a cultural access program for Kitsap County
      to adopt under [RCW.
      36.160.030](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=36.160.030). The
      Washington State Legislature recognized the need for local tools to
      provide public and educational benefits and support for cultural
      organizations.

      County and Vancouver have used these tools to successfully remove barriers
      and increase access to local public programs. Kitsap County can join their
      ranks.
